Welcome to our Envirostats Database website! 

This site has three pages and three main functions. It can be used to view data, input data, and export data to a file.

---------------------------

How to use this site:

1. At the homepage, click the login button and sign in with your @stab.org or @students.stab.org gmail account. Any other gmail account will not be allowed.

2. When on the submit page, you can filter the data you are viewing by river and date and then scroll to find specific data. The columns are sorted by use, so the most commonly used columns are displayed first. 

3. Editing and entering data into the table is extremeley easy! All you have to do is click on the number you want to change (or empty box) and enter the correct data. 

4. To add a new river on a new date, use the top bar to enter first the new river's name (or choose a previously visited river) and the date you visited it. This will create an empty new row in the table for you to fill with new data.

5. On the submit page, there is also a new column field in the top left. Enter the name of the new column, eg. "Sharks" and then click the create button to add this to the table. The new column will be empty for all the rows but easily editable.  

6. If you have finished entering new data and you want to export it, navigate to the Export page to format the data you wish to export. Here, you will be shown all the most recent data and you can once again sort by river and date, as well as by since a certain date.

7. When you hover your mouse over the columns and rows, a red x appears. Click the x to hide the selected column from sight. This will not delete all the data, but rather make it invisible for your exporting purposes. If you accidentally hide a column you may have wanted, the backwards arrow button will undo your most recent change.

8. When you are ready to export, just click Download File in the top left to have a csv file of your data downloaded directly to your computer. This file will be ready to open in many other programs including Excel and Fathom.
